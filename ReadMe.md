# Quality-of-Life Mod

Adds a variety of quality-of-life improvements to the game Nine Sols.

## Installation

1.  Download the [latest release](https://github.com/jngo102/NineSols.QoL/releases/latest) for your particular operating system.
2.  Extract the downloaded .zip file to the folder containing your game's executable, i.e. where `NineSols.exe` is located. When extracted, you should have alongside that .exe a folder called `BepInEx`, a `changelog.txt` text file, and, if you're on Windows, a `doorstop_config.ini` config file and `winhttp.dll` shared library file, or, if you're on macOS, a `libdoorstop.dylib` shared library file and a `run_bepinex.sh` script.
3.  Launch the game and have fun!
